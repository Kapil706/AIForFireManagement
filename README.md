# AIForFireManagement 

Over the past year, we have witnessed long and arduous battles against record-breaking wildfires across the world. Some of these fires burned thousands of acres of land and destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Additionally, smoke from the fire creates issues related to poor air quality, raising health concerns for people not just in the vicinity of the fire, but at distances hundreds of miles away.

`SpotThatFire` application solves the problem using `crowdsourcing` power. Individual citizens who care about nature will contribute and benefit from the system. The application will provide a point-based system for registered users which will give extra enthusiasm.

### What is SpotThatFire?
- Crowdsourcing platform to detect early wildfires and not only wildfires any natural disaster
- Contains NASA open data
- Strong ML to detect possible areas before the fire season, generating heat map and reports
- Notify locals in the area with instructions


### How it works?
SpotThatFire offers mobile apps and only a click you will be able to report a fire. Trained machine learning models filtering photos and allow only photos which fire and smokes to prevent spam. The operation is working on device + on the cloud.From the application, a user can call emergency and get first aid information during the hazard. App also will offer offline sync in near future.

### Domain of the platform
`AIForFire` is intended for media rooms, individual users and government to track every little change in the region. Although this application can be used worldwide.
Interested media rooms can subscribe to the service and get information about early incidents 10-15 minutes earlier which will give them the spotlight.



### How I built it
- The application- Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage, Firebase ML Kit, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Kotlin
- MVP arch
- Retrofit
- Many other 3rd party apps.
